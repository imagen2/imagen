Imagen structural MRI data: segmentation with SPM
=================================================

This Python script has been written for follow-up 2 (FU2) of Imagen.
We have (re)processed structural MRI data from all Imagen time points
with it. The intent was to reproduce prior results on baseline (BL) data.

Unfortunately this script is currently based on a beta version of `Capsul`_
that has not been released.
