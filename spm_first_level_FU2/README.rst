Imagen fMRI data: 1st level processing with SPM
===============================================

These Python scripts have been written for follow-up 2 (FU2) of Imagen.
We have (re)processed fMRI data from all Imagen time points using these scripts.
The intent was to reproduce prior results on baseline (BL) data.

Unfortunately these scripts are currently based on a beta version of `Capsul`_
that has not been released.
